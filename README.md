**Chapter 1 Start from Scratch**  
This is the first chapter in the book and as such there is a lot of, think this way, think that way.  
  
But to simplfy the chapter you should not build too large right off the bat. You should always try to limit yourself to a smaller set of choices. Once you make a choice you should take bad choices off the menu, pick a font size and then look to the left or right (larger smaller) and see if they are a better choice. If you change repeat the process.  
  
Last thing is that you should try and build the feature then the UI. Start with the smallest shippable version of the code and go from there. A comment section without a file upload is better than no comment section at all.  
  
**Chapter 2: Hierarchy is Everything**
