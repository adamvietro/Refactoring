**Chapter 1 Start from Scratch**  
This is the first chapter in the book and as such there is a lot of, think this way, think that way.  
  
But to simplify the chapter you should not build too large right off the bat. You should always try to limit yourself to a smaller set of choices. Once you make a choice you should take bad choices off the menu, pick a font size and then look to the left or right (larger smaller) and see if they are a better choice. If you change repeat the process.  
  
Last thing is that you should try and build the feature then the UI. Start with the smallest shippable version of the code and go from there. A comment section without a file upload is better than no comment section at all.  
  
**Chapter 2: Hierarchy is Everything**  
This chapter is all about what is the most important on a page. When you are building a site think about adding in more contrast and even letting things fall to the background when you are not needing an element to be in the persons focal point.  
  
As you are building headings keep in mind that most of the time they are simply a label and they shouldn't take away from the needed info.  
  
Always try to have the idea that you should have 3 categories for buttons or any actions on a page. Primary (most emphasis), secondary (little emphasis), tertiary (little to no emphasis). This way you will draw a person the most important parts of a page. Keep in mind that while this should be held to once you start the process for an action any confirmations should become the primary and thus be emphasized.
  
**Chapter 3: Layout and Spacing**  
This chapter is all about making the right things have the right size. If you want to make something stand out use a large size of do it. However you might be better off giving a site lots of space and then scaling those elements down to fit what you are looking for.  
  
Also if you are thinking that relative sizing is the way to go you might not have the best plan. Thinking about larger and smaller elements within the page will need to be scaled to a greater or lesser degree depending on the initial size. A title that is 24px will need to be scaled faster than an 14px text. This is because the element will still too large on a smaller screen if not scaled correctly.  
  
Lastly thinking about the page as a whole you will need to have the right spacing to keep items separated. You should have a different spacing for the lines in a bullet point than the space between each bullet point. You should have the space between the title of a text box less than the space between each title and text box that you have on your page.  
  
**Chapter 4: Designing Text**  
This is the chapter about spacing and dealing with text. You should start to find more and more things to look at when it comes to text:  
line-spacing  
line-height  
font-family  
align-items  
  
These are just to name a few. You should also think about how you align and center items. You should always try and align the text in a way that is how the reader will naturally read the text. In most english speaking/reading countries you should align left. You should also try and limit the amount of characters on each line so that the reader will not have to move their eyes as much.  
  
One thing to keep in mind is that line spacing should be based off the size of the text itself. Many times with a larger text you will need less spacing and conversely for smaller text. Even letter-spacing can be changed. You might love a font but its meant to be used in smaller text and will naturally have a larger letter-spacing. You can use the font but change the letter-spacing of the text.  
  
This chapter is all about learning all the tools at your disposal in order to make the most of something as simple as the text on a page.  
  
**Chapter  5: Working with Color**  
This was a great chapter and its mostly follows around the HSL color system. In short this is about Hue (color), Saturation(Grey to full color), and Lightness (how light a color is). Now brightness is a different thing from Lightness. With this scale it will be easier to keep the same color and change things about the color to get a different set of blues to work with.  
  
What is also nice is that you can also use the absolute brightness of colors to slide a hue closer to a brighter color on the wheel to get more pop from a color that is already maxed out on Lightness.  
  
As for the system in this chapter you should build all the colors you want before you build the site. That way you can work with them as you build. Same things as before you want to have up to 8 of each of the main colors. Lastly you should always think about color blind people as they can still see differences in lightness and can see differences in slight changes in Hue.  
  
**Chapter 6: Creating Depth**
This is the chapter that focuses on creating depth in your page. If you look at a real world item (raised) it will have more light on the top and less light on the bottom. The converse is true for inset items. This is a way to create some depth for an item on your page.  
  
Also think about an item that is completely off the page. It will create a larger and larger shadow as you raise it more off the page. So increase the size of the shadow as you pull it further and further from the page.  
  
YOu can also create some depth with the colors you choose, see the absolute brightness scale. OR even how you overlap items on your page. Overlaying items will make sure that an user knows that an item is over an other. Lastly you should think about making items dynamic by making a hover or a click raise or inset an item.  
  
**Chapter 7: Working with Images**
