**Chapter 1 Start from Scratch**  
This is the first chapter in the book and as such there is a lot of, think this way, think that way.  
  
But to simplify the chapter you should not build too large right off the bat. You should always try to limit yourself to a smaller set of choices. Once you make a choice you should take bad choices off the menu, pick a font size and then look to the left or right (larger smaller) and see if they are a better choice. If you change repeat the process.  
  
Last thing is that you should try and build the feature then the UI. Start with the smallest shippable version of the code and go from there. A comment section without a file upload is better than no comment section at all.  
  
**Chapter 2: Hierarchy is Everything**  
This chapter is all about what is the most important on a page. When you are building a site think about adding in more contrast and even letting things fall to the background when you are not needing an element to be in the persons focal point.  
  
As you are building headings keep in mind that most of the time they are simply a label and they shouldn't take away from the needed info.  
  
Always try to have the idea that you should have 3 categories for buttons or any actions on a page. Primary (most emphasis), secondary (little emphasis), tertiary (little to no emphasis). This way you will draw a person the most important parts of a page. Keep in mind that while this should be held to once you start the process for an action any confirmations should become the primary and thus be emphasized.
